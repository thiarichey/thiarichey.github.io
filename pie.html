		<h1>Pecan pie</h1>
		<p>This is mostly King Arthur Flour's recipe, but I changed enough things I wanted to commit it to memory. I like the addition of flour in the KAF filling, but I think it makes the pie a little too <i>sturdy</i>, like a pumpkin pie. This one has a more traditional texture (more moisture from the maple syrup), and a darker, more carmelized flavor (brown butter, dark brown sugar).</p>
		<p>
		Filling:
			<ul>
				<li>400g dark molasses-y brown sugar </li>
				<li>30g flour</li>
				<li>85g milk</li>
				<li>8 tbsp butter</li>
				<li>50g good maple syrup</li>
				<li>1 tbsp vanilla (I use a mix of extract and paste)</li>
				<li>1/2 tsp maple extract</li>
				<li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
				<li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
				<li>2 tsp cider vinegar</li>
				<li>splash bourbon, optional</li>
				<li>a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2010/12/recipe-p-te-bris-e/67263/">pie crust</a>, parbaked for 20 minutes in a 400F oven and cooled</li>
				<li>pecans, toasted for 10-12 minutes in a 350F oven, 3/4 cup roughly chopped, 1 cup left whole</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>First, preheat the oven to 375F. Brown the butter and set aside to cool. It doesn't need to be completely cool, but it should be lukewarm by the time it's mixed into the other things.</p>
		<p>Stir together sugar, flour, salt, then add milk, eggs, and maple syrup and mix until well-combined. Then add the vinegar, bourbon (if using), extracts, and vinegar. Finally, add the butter.</p>
		<p>Pour mixture into your prepared pie shell and bake for 50 minutes or so on a baking sheet, until the top is puffed and the center jiggles only a little when moved.</p>
