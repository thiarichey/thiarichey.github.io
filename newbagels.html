		<h1>New Bagels</h1>
		<p>This is what I've been doing recently, with some variations, but here's the basic idea. <a href="labbagel.jpeg">Here</a> <a href="crumb2.jpeg">are</a>  <a href="magus.jpeg">some</a> <a href="bottom.jpeg">pictures</a> <a href="lots.jpeg">of</a> <a href="latte.jpeg">what</a> <a href="crumb3.jpeg">they</a> <a href="oliver.jpeg">look</a> <a href="another.jpeg">like</a>. These bagels differ from my original recipe in that they are slightly softer, less "bready", without being squishy or airy. The dough has a light sweetness and maltiness, and the crust crackles slightly while still being more of a "skin" than a crust. They also stale better, due to the inclusion of sugar and oil. If you want to shave a few hours off the overnight rest, you can replace 1% of the sugar with diastatic malt.</p>
		<p>I do use some specialized ingredients and equipment, including <a href="https://www.generalmillscf.com/products/category/flour/hard-spring-wheat/all-trumps-enriched-malted-50lb">high-gluten bread flour</a>, <a href="https://breadtopia.com/store/organic-diastatic-barley-malt-powder/">diastatic malt powder</a>, and <a href="https://breadtopia.com/store/barley-malt-syrup/">barley malt syrup</a>. For completeness' sake, I use <a href="https://www.fredmeyer.com/p/red-star-quick-rise-instant-yeast/0001792900023?fulfillment=PICKUP&storecode=70100608&&cid=shp_adw_shopl_.fred+meyer_g_lia_shop_acq_evgn_ship_pantry&gclid=Cj0KCQjwkOqZBhDNARIsAACsbfLhPPaRDmC6pV1G5NoWQXM4sY7YzboXAkTuzVEZR3FWFyGsnz6QQNAaAhnMEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">this</a> yeast, Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt, and Crystal Geyser Alpine Spring Water. I also have a <a href="https://www.boschmixers.com/product/bosch-universal-plus-mixer/">really intense mixer</a>, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CGTJNM4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">pizza stone</a>, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C6CN1VY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1">kitchen scale</a>, and <a href="https://breadtopia.com/store/bagel-boards/">bagel boards</a>.</p>

		Recipe:
			<ul>
				<li>high-gluten flour: 100%</li>
				<li>water: 50%</li>
				<li>instant yeast: 0.25%</li>
				<li>salt: 2.15%</li>
				<li>neutral oil (like grapeseed, sunflower): 3%</li>
				<li>extra dark molasses-y brown sugar: 5%</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Stir the dry ingredients together, then add the wet and knead in your mixer for approximately 10 minutes. The challenge of this dough is that it never really looks good during the mixing stage. <a href="5min.jpeg">Here's</a> what it looks like after about 5 minutes of mixing; <a href="10min.jpeg">here</a> is what it looks like after 10. You'll know it's getting there when it starts to ribbon around the dough hook like saltwater taffy, and the dough stretches easily in your hands and feels hydrated. At this point, rest the dough, covered, for 20 minutes to an hour, until it's fully smoothed out and looks like <a href="rested.jpeg">this</a>.</p>
		<p>The dough will be challenging to shape before resting, but transforms following it, and becomes remarkably easy to roll out. Shape the bagels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP-ryvz_bRM">this</a>, slicing off approximately 140g strips of dough. Place shaped bagels on a baking sheet covered in parchment paper and lightly misted with oil; I get 12 bagels per sheet.</p>
		<p>Rest bagels, covered, at room temperature, until they float when dropped into a bowl of water. This is highly dependent on your kitchen's temperature conditions, but I find it usually takes about an hour. Transfer to the fridge to rest overnight.</p>
		<p>The next day, ideally 12 to 16 hours later, get your oven as hot as possible, soak your bagel boards, boil water, and remove the bagels from the fridge. Add a big spoonful of malt syrup (or molasses, or honey, or whatever) to your boiling liquid. Boil bagels 10-15 seconds per side. Once they come out of the boiling liquid, arrange them face-down on the bagel boards.</p>
		<p>Place boards directly on the pizza stone and allow to bake for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, flip the boards so the bagels have direct contact with the stone and are now facing upwards. Bake another 5-10 minutes until desired doneness is reached; remove from oven, and rest bagels on cooling racks for at least 15 minutes.</p>
