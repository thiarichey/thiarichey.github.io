	I am a student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu">University of Washington</a>, graduating March 2023. Currently, I am taking coursework in <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse333/22wi/">systems programming</a> and <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse431/22wi/">theory of computation</a>. I also tutor calculus at UW's <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~msc/">Math Study Center</a> and intern with <a href="https://geneial.com">Geneial</a>, where I develop privacy-protecting querying tools that allow users to derive insights from encrypted data. You can contact me by <a href = "mailto: gannet@cs.washington.edu">email</a> or add me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thia-richey-5b5206149/">LinkedIn</a>.

	Although I have lived in Seattle since 2016, I am originally from Columbia, South Carolina, a city I once heard described as "a hot concrete bowl". I don't disagree with this characterization, but I love it anyway. Outside of class, I enjoy coffee, cooking, and media of all kinds. I'm fond of unstyled HTML sites&#8212they're classic!&#8212but I can write a GUI should the need arise.
