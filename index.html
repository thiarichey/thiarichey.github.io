	I am a student in the combined BS/MS program at the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu">University of Washington</a>, majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics. I will graduate with my master's degree Winter 2024. My research interests lie in programming languages: I was a teaching assistant for UW's undergraduate PL course, <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/22sp/">CSE 341</a>, this past spring. I am also involved in undergraduate research with the <a href="https://uwplse.org">PLSE group</a>, working on <a href="https://github.com/uwplse/ruler">ruler</a>.

	Currently, I am an intern at AT&T's Atlanta office, where I am a developer on the TDP tools team. Previously, I interned with genomics startup <a href="https://geneial.com">Geneial</a>, where I developed privacy-protecting querying tools which allow users to derive insights from encrypted data. I have also worked as a tutor for the <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~msc/">Math Study Center</a>, a drop-in tutoring resource for students taking UW's introductory calculus sequence. You can contact me by <a href = "mailto: gannet@cs.washington.edu">email</a> or add me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cynthia-richey-5b5206149/">LinkedIn</a>.

	Although I have lived in Seattle since 2016, I am originally from Columbia, South Carolina, a city I once heard described as "a hot concrete bowl". I don't disagree with this characterization, but I love it anyway. Outside of class, I enjoy coffee, cooking, and media of all kinds. I'm fond of unstyled HTML sites&#8212they're classic!&#8212but I can write a GUI should the need arise.
