		<h1>Cynthia Richey</h1>
	<p>
	I am a master's student at the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu">University of Washington</a>, doing research with the <a href="https://uwplse.org">PLSE group</a>. My primary interest is in <a href="https://egraphs-good.github.io">equality saturation</a>, but I also like language design, formal verification, and probably some other things&#8212I'm still figuring it out. I am advised by <a href="https://ztatlock.net">Zachary Tatlock</a> and <a href="https://cnandi.com">Chandrakana Nandi</a>. I will be applying to PhD programs this coming cycle; if you have any thoughts on that, you should <a href = "mailto: gannet@cs.washington.edu">contact me</a>.
</p>
<p>
	This past summer, I was a research intern at <a href="https://www.certora.com">Certora</a>, working on equality saturation and mutation testing applications. The previous summer, I was a software engineer intern at AT&T. There, I finally learned JavaScript, so now I have no excuse not to make this website better, and yet I resist. Before that, I interned with genomics startup <a href="https://geneial.com">Geneial</a>, where I developed privacy-protecting querying tools which allow users to derive insights from encrypted data. I have also worked as a tutor for the <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~msc/">Math Study Center</a>, a drop-in tutoring resource for students taking UW's introductory calculus sequence, and as a teaching assistant for UW's undergraduate programming languages course, <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/22sp/">CSE 341</a>.

	Although I have lived in Seattle since 2016, I am originally from Columbia, South Carolina, a city I once heard described as "a hot concrete bowl". I don't disagree with this characterization, but I love it anyway. Outside of school, I listen to loud, weird music and cook an improbable amount. I go by Thia, usually.
