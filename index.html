	I recently graduated from the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu">University of Washington</a> with a major in computer science and a minor in mathematics. This fall, I will continue my studies at UW as part of the combined BS/MS program, doing research with the <a href="https://uwplse.org">PLSE group</a>. My primary interest is in <a href="https://egraphs-good.github.io">equality saturation</a>, but I also like language design, formal verification, and probably some other things&#8212I'm still figuring it out. I am advised by <a href="https://ztatlock.net">Zachary Tatlock</a> and <a href="https://ajpal.github.io">Anjali Pal</a>, with whom I work on <a href="https://github.com/uwplse/ruler">ruler</a>. I will be applying to PhD programs this coming cycle; if you have any thoughts on that, you should <a href = "mailto: gannet@cs.washington.edu">contact me</a>.

	I'll be doing cool formal verification research stuff at <a href="https://www.certora.com">Certora</a> this summer. Last summer, I was a software engineer intern at AT&T. There, I finally learned JavaScript, so now I have no excuse not to make this website better, and yet I resist. Previously, I interned with genomics startup <a href="https://geneial.com">Geneial</a>, where I developed privacy-protecting querying tools which allow users to derive insights from encrypted data. I have also worked as a tutor for the <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~msc/">Math Study Center</a>, a drop-in tutoring resource for students taking UW's introductory calculus sequence, and as a teaching assistant for UW's undergraduate programming languages course, <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/22sp/">CSE 341</a>.

	Although I have lived in Seattle since 2016, I am originally from Columbia, South Carolina, a city I once heard described as "a hot concrete bowl". I don't disagree with this characterization, but I love it anyway. Outside of school, I listen to loud, weird music and cook an improbable amount. I go by Thia, usually.
